I. Introduction
--
Our paper is submitting, and we decide to public our dataset in advance.

DOSR is a public datasets with 1065 optical remote sensing images and 5876 ship instances. The image size is ranged from 600 pixels to 1300 pixels. 
In DOSR, there are 831 nearshore scenes containing 5212 instances and 234 offshore scenes containing 915 instances. 

The dataset is divided into three sets: training set with 523 images, validation set with 223 images and testing set with 320 images. 
Fig.1 displays examples of 20 fine-grained classes in DOSR. Instance amount of each class is shown in Table I.

Each instance, no matter how small, is annotated with five-parameter tuple (x,y,w,h,θ）：
